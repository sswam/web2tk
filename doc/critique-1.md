First of all, congratulations on a well-structured setup! You're already thinking along the right lines to make your code portable between Node.js and Deno. However, creating symlinks as a temporary solution isn't the most elegant or robust way to achieve portability. Here are some more streamlined ways to solve your problem, followed by some additional feedback on the overall setup.

### Improving Environment-Specific Imports

#### Option 1: Dynamic Imports
You can dynamically import the environment-specific modules within the `server.js` file itself. This way, you avoid using a symlink altogether:

```javascript
// server.js

let env;
if (typeof Deno !== 'undefined') {
	env = await import('./deno.js');
} else if (typeof process !== 'undefined' && process?.versions?.node) {
	env = await import('./node.js');
}

const { parseHTML, readTextFile, writeTextFile, args } = env;
import { process } from './web2tk.js';

export async function processFiles(inputFile, dataFile, outputFile) {
	const jsonData = await readTextFile(dataFile);
	const data = JSON.parse(jsonData);

	const inputHtml = await readTextFile(inputFile);
	const { document: doc } = parseHTML(inputHtml);

	if (!doc) {
		throw new Error("Failed to parse the HTML.");
	}

	process(doc, data);

	const updatedHtml = doc.toString();
	await writeTextFile(outputFile, updatedHtml);
}

export async function main() {
	const [input = "input.html", data = "data.json", output = "output.html"] = args;
	await processFiles(input, data, output);
}

if (typeof Deno !== 'undefined' && import.meta.main || typeof process !== 'undefined' && process?.versions?.node) {
	main();
}
```

### Critique and Suggestions for Further Improvements

#### Code Readability and Maintainability:

1. **Consistent Naming**: Make sure your variable and function names are intuitive and consistent across files. For example, `processFiles` could perhaps be more descriptively named `processHtmlFiles` to clarify its purpose.

2. **Error Handling**: Currently, you throw an error if HTML parsing fails, but having more granular error messages and handling can be more useful.

3. **Folder Structure**: Your files are adequately organized, but consider placing all JS files within a `src` folder for even better structure.

4. **Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments to your functions. This will make your code more readable and maintainable.

Here's an example for `processFiles`:

```javascript
/**
 * Processes the input HTML by replacing elements' textContent based on JSON data.
 *
 * @param {string} inputFile - Path to the input HTML file.
 * @param {string} dataFile - Path to the JSON data file.
 * @param {string} outputFile - Path to the output HTML file.
 * @returns {Promise<void>}
 */
export async function processHtmlFiles(inputFile, dataFile, outputFile) {
	// Function body...
}
```

### Example of Enhanced Error Handling
```javascript
export async function processHtmlFiles(inputFile, dataFile, outputFile) {
	try {
		const jsonData = await readTextFile(dataFile);
		const data = JSON.parse(jsonData);

		const inputHtml = await readTextFile(inputFile);
		const { document: doc } = parseHTML(inputHtml);

		if (!doc) {
			throw new Error("HTML parsing failed. The document is null.");
		}

		process(doc, data);
		const updatedHtml = doc.toString();

		await writeTextFile(outputFile, updatedHtml);
	} catch (error) {
		console.error(`Error processing files: ${error.message}`);
	}
}
```

### Miscellaneous Tips

1. **Performance**: Consider whether synchronous file reading operations might be acceptable, as they are easier to reason about. However, for large files, asynchronous operations (as you're doing) are generally better.

2. **Testing**: Include unit tests to cover different scenarios, such as malformed JSON or HTML files, missing attributes, and so on. This ensures robustness and reliability of your utility.

3. **TypeScript**: Consider using TypeScript for better type safety and improved development experience.

4. **Logging**: Add more logging statements, especially around critical operations. It will make debugging easier.

### Conclusion
By dynamically importing the environment-specific modules, adding consistency in naming, improving error handling, and considering some optional upgrades, your overall project will be more robust, more maintainable, and easier to debug.
