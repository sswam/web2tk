Here are some common primitive operations used in localization (l10n):

1. **Pluralization**:
        - Adjusting nouns and verbs for singular, dual, trial, paucal, and plural forms.

2. **Gender Agreement**:
        - Ensuring nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and verbs agree in gender (e.g., masculine, feminine, neuter).

3. **Ordinal Suffixes**:
        - Adding appropriate ordinal indicators (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th in English).

4. **Date and Time Formatting**:
        - Converting dates and times to the appropriate local format (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY vs DD/MM/YYYY).

5. **Currency Formatting**:
        - Adjusting the display of currency amounts including symbol placement and decimal/currency separators.

6. **Numeric Formatting**:
        - Applying locale-specific numeric separators (e.g., 1,000.50 vs 1.000,50).

7. **Measurement Units**:
        - Converting units of measure to local standards (e.g., miles to kilometers, Fahrenheit to Celsius).

8. **Text Direction**:
        - Changing text alignment based on writing system (e.g., left-to-right for Latin script, right-to-left for Arabic script).

9. **Capitalization Rules**:
        - Adapting capitalization rules for different languages (e.g., title case in English vs. sentence case in other languages).

10. **Transliteration**:
    - Converting text from one script to another while maintaining pronunciation.

11. **Grammar Adjustments**:
    - Modifying sentence structure to fit local grammatical rules.

12. **Contextual Phrasing**:
    - Adapting phrases to fit cultural context (e.g., formal vs. informal address).

13. **Address and Phone Number Formatting**:
    - Converting addresses and phone numbers to match local formats.

14. **Collation**:
    - Adjusting how strings are sorted alphabetically in the target locale.

Each of these operations ensures that content is appropriately tailored for the target audience's language, culture, and preferences.
